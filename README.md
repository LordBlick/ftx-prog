**ftx-prog** is a Linux command-line alternative to the [FTProg](http://www.ftdichip.com/Support/Utilities.htm#FT_Prog) utility for [FTDI](http://www.ftdichip.com/)'s [FT-X series](http://www.ftdichip.com/FT-X.htm) of USB interfaces.

## Installation

Install some prerequisites

```
sudo apt-get install build-essential gcc make libftdi-dev
```

then download and

```
make
```

Don't forget to plug in your FT-X device!

## Usage

```
sudo ./ftx_prog
```

This should give you full details on all the possible options.

### Display Current Settings

```
sudo ./ftx_prog --dump
```

### Inverting RS232 Signals

```
sudo ./ftx_prog --invert [rs232 pin]
```

This will invert the polarity of this pin on the chip. So if it was Active High it'll become Active Low and visa versa. You can use `--dump` to see if the pin is in its default state or not.

The possible pins are:
* txd
* rxd
* rts
* cts
* dtr
* dsr
* dcd
* ri

### CBUS Pins

```
sudo ./ftx_prog --cbus [cbus pin number] [function]
```

Sets up configurable CBUS pins with a particular function. Have a look at `--help` to see them all, and ยง7.12 of [this application note](http://www.ftdichip.com/Support/Documents/AppNotes/AN_201_FT-X%20MTP%20Memory%20Configuration.pdf) to see what they all do.

The most commonly used are:

* RxLED		*(pulses low when data is being sent from the host to the USB device)*
* TxLED		*(pulses low when data is being sent from the USB device to the host)*
* TxRxLED	*(pulses low when data is being sent either way)*
* SLEEP		*(goes low when the interface is in USB suspend mode)*

### I2C

### RS485

### Misc
